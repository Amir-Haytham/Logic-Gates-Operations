# Logic Gates Circuits Simulation Operations
Simple Implementation for some of Logic Gates Circuits. Project presented in Physics (BS221) Course. Implemented with C++.

# The Operations
* OR gate and show truth table 
* AND gate and show truth table 
* NOT gate and show truth table 
* Buffer gate and show truth table 
* XOR gate and show truth table 
* XNOR gate and show truth table 
* NOR gate and show truth table 
* NAND gate and show truth table  
* 1's complement  
* 2's complement  
* Adding two numbers as a binary. Also, as a decimal and display it in binary  
* Bases conversions
